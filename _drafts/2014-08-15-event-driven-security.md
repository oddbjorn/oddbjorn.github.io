The arguably de facto standard for managing information security has so far been ISO/IEC 27001, which prior to the 2013 revision described the following framework for delivering "managed information security":

As the figure shows, the key feature is the Information Security Management System (ISMS). The goal of the ISMS is to facilitate continuous improvement of the state of information security in the organization.

In an ideal world, this 


Alas, for many organizations,

- disconnected
- piggybacked

- quality of controls (SMART, effectiveness, efficient, cost, feasability, viable, desirable)
- coverage of controls

Viable System Model

In Brain of the Firm (p. 163) Beer describes a triple vector to characterize activity in a System 1. The components are:
Actuality: "What we are managing to do now, with existing resources, under existing constraints."
Capability: "This is what we could be doing (still right now) with existing resources, under existing constraints, if we really worked at it."
Potentiality: "This is what we ought to be doing by developing our resources and removing constraints, although still operating within the bounds of what is already known to be feasible."
Beer adds "It would help a lot to fix these definitions clearly in the mind." System 4's job is essentially to realize potential. He then defines
Productivity: is the ratio of actuality and capability;
Latency: is the ratio of capability and potentiality;
Performance: is the ratio of actuality and potentiality, and also the product of latency and productivity.

Unlike the five previous dimensions, the Effective Response, Recovery & Resilience => Robustness?
