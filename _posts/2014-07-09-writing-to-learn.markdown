Around fifteen years ago, my primary attention shifted from Unix and system management to working exclusively within the field of information security. While it&#8217;s hard to claim that the overall security standing haven&#8217;t improved in the past decade, it is fair to say that we still have a long way to go in this area.

I believe that the field of security can benefit from looking at recent developments in surrounding areas, for example:

- software development has shifted from a traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall approach</a> to <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">more agile ways</a> in order to produce better quality while costs are under control.
- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking">systems thinking</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems">complexity theory</a> to better understand the forces and counter-forces with regard to security
- true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis#Requirements_engineering">requirements engineering</a>; instead of just picking security requirements out of the hat (or a plausible security standard)

Around a decade ago, I read <a href="http://www.williamzinsserwriter.com/">William Zinnser</a> &#8217;s inspiring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Learn-William-Zinsser/dp/0062720406">Writing to Learn</a>. In his book, Zinsser promotes the process of writing in order to better understand a topic by forcing oneself to deeper thinking. Expressed in a nutshell by Toby Fulwiler and Art Young:

> Writing to learn is different. We write to ourselves as well as talk with others to objectify our perceptions of reality; the primary function of this &#8220;expressive&#8221; language is not to communicate, but to order and represent experience to our own understanding. In this sense language provides us with a unique way of knowing and becomes a tool for discovering, for shaping meaning, and for reaching understanding.

While I may be a slow adopter, this blog is my attempt to use this philosophy to &#8220;connect the dots&#8221;. I will try to keep the postings within the realm of information security in its widest sense, it may occasionally delve into wholly unrelated topics. Only time will tell if I also remember anything from one of Zinsser&#8217;s other books: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-25th-Anniversary-Nonfiction/dp/0060006641">On Writing Well</a> ..
